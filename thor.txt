Title: Thor’s Redemption – The Final Strike

After the failure to stop Thanos in Wakanda and the guilt of "I should've gone for the head," Thor sinks into despair. But in this alternative ending, Thor discovers a spark of hope.

As the Avengers face Thanos in the final battle, Thor finally finds clarity. Instead of arriving overweight and depressed, he summons all the powers of the All-Father — Odin’s spirit awakens inside him.

His armor reforms, glowing with blue lightning and ancient runes. Stormbreaker and Mjolnir both respond to him at the same time.

Thor realizes the key to defeating Thanos isn’t brute strength…
…it’s combining Stormbreaker and Mjolnir to channel a god-level lightning surge strong enough to destroy the Infinity Stones’ power field.

He leaps into the sky, spins both weapons, and unleashes The World-Breaker Thunder, a blast so powerful it forces Thanos to drop the gauntlet.

Iron Man uses the opening — but this time, Thor helps him survive by absorbing half the energy of the stones during the snap.

Tony lives.

Thor collapses, exhausted, but smiling:

> “I finally aimed for the head.”



The universe is saved — and Thor begins a new journey as the reborn King of Asgard.
