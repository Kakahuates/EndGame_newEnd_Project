Instead of growing old by staying in the past, Steve Rogers returned the Infinity Stones and came back to the present, a man out of time once more. The fight was over, but he felt the world still needed a shield. He declined retirement and, with the help of Sam Wilson and Bucky Barnes, established a new global organization focused on humanitarian aid and training a new generation of heroes. He found a new purpose not by reliving the past, but by building a better future. He never did get that dance, but he found a different kind of peace, serving others to the very end.
