<h2 align="center">New ending for the Avenger</h2>

<p>
Title: Thor’s Redemption – The Final Strike

After the failure to stop Thanos in Wakanda and the guilt of "I should've gone for the head," Thor sinks into despair. But in this alternative ending, Thor discovers a spark of hope.

As the Avengers face Thanos in the final battle, Thor finally finds clarity. Instead of arriving overweight and depressed, he summons all the powers of the All-Father — Odin’s spirit awakens inside him.

His armor reforms, glowing with blue lightning and ancient runes. Stormbreaker and Mjolnir both respond to him at the same time.

Thor realizes the key to defeating Thanos isn’t brute strength…
…it’s combining Stormbreaker and Mjolnir to channel a god-level lightning surge strong enough to destroy the Infinity Stones’ power field.

He leaps into the sky, spins both weapons, and unleashes The World-Breaker Thunder, a blast so powerful it forces Thanos to drop the gauntlet.

Iron Man uses the opening — but this time, Thor helps him survive by absorbing half the energy of the stones during the snap.

Tony lives.

Thor collapses, exhausted, but smiling:

> “I finally aimed for the head.”

Instead of growing old by staying in the past, Steve Rogers returned the Infinity Stones and came back to the present, a man out of time once more. The fight was over, but he felt the world still needed a shield. He declined retirement and, with the help of Sam Wilson and Bucky Barnes, established a new global organization focused on humanitarian aid and training a new generation of heroes. He found a new purpose not by reliving the past, but by building a better future. He never did get that dance, but he found a different kind of peace, serving others to the very end.
